# QNodeView
Qt Node View

This is just an experiment for now.
I am trying to implement a node editor or view using Qt's Model View framework.
The idea is to use the view to build GLSL shaders using nodes similar to Blender's approach, it may be useful for something else later, like game AI pattern programing or state machines.

It may not get anywhere. Do not get your hopes up. If you feel inspired and beat me to the punch, good for you, I'd like to see your project, if you want to help out, post your pull requests.


Nothing to see here (yet) though.
